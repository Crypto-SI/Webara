## Core Features:

- Landing Page Showcase: Displays key elements from the attached image such as the WEBUILD DIGITAL EXPERIENCES title, portfolio and About us Sections.
- Form Submission: Captures contact details and initial project ideas as described in the image.
- AI Quote and Collaboration Suggestion Tool: Analyzes user input (website needs, collaboration preferences) and suggests optimal collaboration options. The available options can include suggestions like a 'free site for 20% of revenues' or a 'price per lead' model, adjusting the advice based on the project's scope and user's specific requirements. Uses an LLM as a tool to do so.

## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Burnt orange (#E56B4F) for a warm and inviting feel, derived from the call-to-action button in the image.
- Background color: Off-white (#F5F5F5), matching the clean, modern aesthetic from the design. The background hue has a hint of orange, approximately matching the primary color.
- Accent color: Mustard yellow (#FFB84A), echoing the header texts, offering a balanced contrast. Its lightness and saturation are clearly differentiated from the primary color to enhance contrast.
- Headline font: 'Poppins' sans-serif, for a geometric and contemporary style that would also be suitable for short passages of text.
- Note: currently only Google Fonts are supported.
- Mirrors the design provided with a grid layout.
- Subtle page transition animations when navigating between sections.
